            <h2>GLUTE BRIDGES</h2>
            <div class="full-description full-description-glute">
                <big>GLUTE BRIDGES</big> are a great way to activiate your glutes before a run. Lots of runners are quad dominant when they run, which can cause problems with overuse injuries and inefficient form.
        To do a glute bridge, lie on your back on the floor. Place your heels on the ground so your knees are at a 40 degree angle. Tense your core so that your lower back is flat against the floor. If you tried to slide your hand between your back and the floor you wouldn't be able to do it.
        Now, with your upper back and head maintaining contact with the floor, press up through your feet and raise your hips to the ceiling. Maintain the 'neutral' spine by keeping your core tight. Hold for a few seconds then lower back down and repeat.

        <div class="block hitch">
            <h2>HIP HITCHES</h2>
            <div class="full-description full-description-hitch">
                <big>HIP HITCHES</big> are really important in activating your glute medius muscles. Running places a lot of emphasis on 
                your hip flexors, so they tend to get much stronger than your glut medius muscles. Both of these muscles play an important part
                of hip stabalization, therefore it's important to train both equally. To do these exercises, stand on a box with one leg, and let the other hang
                toward the floor. Now engage your core and 'hitch' your hip toward the ceiling. Hold for a second or two then lower down.

        <div class="block calf">
            <h2>CALF WALK</h2>
            <div class="full-description full-description-calf">
                <big>CALVES</big> are one of the most important muscles in your leg when it comes to running. They're responsible for most of the springiness you feel in your stride.
                Therefore it is important to warm them up properly in order to avoid straining them and the achilles tendon. Your achilles reportedly withstands 400% of your body weight in force
                while running, so doing these calf walks is one step you can take to avoid injury. To do this, simply stand on your tip toes and slowly walk forwards and backwards. Between each step, 
                with the foot that is not on the ground, flex your toes toward the ceiling to engage the muscles in the front of your shin too.

        <div class="block quad">
            <h2>QUAD STRETCH</h2>
            <div class="full-description full-description-quad">
                <big>QUAD STRETCHES</big> are another movement you should consider before running. These help loosen up the 
                muscles in the front of the leg and hip. To do this stand on one leg. Reach back behind you and grab your other foot. 
                To deepen the stretch, reach to the ceiling with your other hand.
                Hold each stretch for 5-15 seconds. Make sure to tense your core and glutes to maintain a neutral spine.
